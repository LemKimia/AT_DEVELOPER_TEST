# Country Information App

This is a front-end web application showcasing basic information about countries.

Provides a user-friendly interface with clear headings and sections.
Technology Stack:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript (Optional: Framework like React or Vue.js, if used)
Running the Project:

Clone this repository.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Note:

This project is intended as a demonstration of front-end development skills.
The data source for country information can be replaced with a real API integration for a more robust application.
Further Development:

Implement data fetching from a country information API.
Add interactive features like search functionality or filtering by region.
Enhance the user interface with animations or responsive design.
I hope this README provides a clear overview of my project. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback.
